- Is assigned value by the planning group.
- Lists a deadline.
- States dependencies, if any.

# Task Approach Template

- **Title of Task**: Endeavor to be succinct but accurate with the title. Always ask yourself: "Is this a vague title, or does it give a unique and understandable description that is immediately understandable?"
- **Description of Task**: This is a verbose explanation of the task from a primarily qualitative perspective.
- **Definition of Task**: This needs to be a much more in-depth accounting of what, who, and how for the task.
- **What**: The Purpose of the task, the reason it exists. This can be of considerable detail to effectively explain to persons interested in the task.
- **Who**: Name the principal responsible party and any other persons on the task.
- **How**: Intended strategies to address any subtasks. Multiple strategies can be listed and described.
- **Criteria for Success**: What determines how success is defined?** Success in this definition means that the task will be closed.
- **Open Questions**: Are there any issues/questions that need to be resolved to satisfy the Success Criteria?
- **Connected/Dependent Tasks**: Are there tasks that exist at the genesis of this task or anticipated that either guide this task or are guided by this task? List them by their GitHub number.
- **Timetable**: Establish an end-to-end schedule of events and milestones to accomplish the task and subtasks.
- **Revisions**: Sets how many revisions of the submitted work will be reviewed by the task manager..

# Task Lifecycle
1. Task created per format requirements by TM.
2. Task assigned to Contributor.
3. Contributor submits deliverable to TTR for review by deadline.

Case 1: task deliverable is considered complete by the TTR and is pulled into the master branch by either the TTR or TM. Task is closed by either the TTR or TM.
  
Case 2: task is considered incomplete by the TTR. TTR returns feedback to Contributor and either
Asks Contributor to complete task or

Reassigns task to new Contributor.

4. Late tasks:
Contributor should inform TM with as much notice as possible if they believe that the task deadline will not be met.
TM will either revise deadline, change Contributors, or assign more effort to the task in order to the meet the deadline.

# File Management
- The task manager(s) shall be responsible for file management within Github.
- Draft deliverables shall clearly state their author(s)
- Working files (sketches, incomplete files, in progress files, or files otherwise not part of mission documentation) shall not be pulled into the repository unless they are clearly marked as working files.
- Files and folders in the repository will follow [TBD nomenclature and format standards. See issue #99 ].
